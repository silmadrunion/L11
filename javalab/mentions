when trying to put the maven dependency for SpringFox so that I can use swagger, namely
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>

I ran into an invalid classpath error; same happens with spring-security for https services or jwt tokens, and I can not figure out where exactly the issue is
The whole application can no longer work if I try it out, and I spent too much time even fixing it back into a working state (lesson learned about backups)
